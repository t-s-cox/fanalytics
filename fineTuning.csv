Dabo Haters have been waiting for this day.  Will he bounce back?  Find out next time on CFBall Z!,2
Reporter should ask Dabo about 'clemsoning' in the post game presser.  Reprise of the question many years ago just to watch him freak out and go off.    Oh man I would pay to see that!,2
Did Dabo give either half a grade in the post conference?,4
Feel sorry for UNC. My bet is Clemson hangs 50-60 in Chapel Bill. They are not very good on D or O. Losing 27-3 early in 3rd to UCF.,3
17.5 point underdog won in Death Valley on a must-win for desperate Clemson. This was no fluke. Syracuse never trailed. Won by nearly two TD‚Äôs. Even their backup QB scored. Ouch. Made ‚ÄòCuse look like a top 29-30 team.,1

Yep its an annoying storyline,3
LFG,6
Venables was absolutely a HUGE part of the success. Scott was a huge part of the offense. I don't think losing them is 100% the issue but it's definitely a big part of it.,5

He was a caller that got into it with Dabo on a radio show and Dabo refuses to talk to callers now,3
The beef you needed to hear.  I think it happened in 2023.  Tyler vs. Dabo.  May still be recorded somewhere.,3
A couple years ago a guy from Spartanburg called into a radio show that dabo was on and complained about how dabo was running the program. Dabo proceeded to go on a massive rant about how Clemson fans are spoiled and they should be grateful with the success they‚Äôve had.,3
"""He‚Äôs basically a fan that called in to the radio show when Dabo first started to shit the bed, took him down Broadway on the problems - and Dabo went holier than thou on him""",2

"""Alright Notre Dame, that's on you for finally realizing that. You're better than this""",3

I am one side quest away from 100%ing Red Dead 2. It has taken me 5 years but I just needed to tell someone. Thank you for your time,6
Interviewing Dabo right now is hilarious,5
"""This team is fantastic, just needs to work on offense, defense, special teams, tackling, running the ball, passing the ball, offensive play calling, defensive play calling, pass blocking, run blocking, catching the ball, scoring points, stopping the other team from scoring points, and coaching""",0

"""Now I'm not getting paid what these coaches are, so Im not expert.  But I don't think you can keep trading points for no points""",2

No lighting delay this team is probably 0-4 losing to Troy,3

Clemson has had more lighting delays than wins this season. We‚Äôre entering Week 5 next week,0
"""He was right, 1-2 isn't that bad. 1-3 is much worse""",1

Shoutout to the forgotten Kelly Bryant season between Deshaun and Trevor,4

"""If it's any consolation to the Clempson bros, you can watch Carolina get booty blasted in a few hours with abysmal offensive play calling.""",1
Clemsons scheme to trick kids from being a South Carolina fan by winning for a decade before inserting them into a life time of being a 90‚Äôs - 00‚Äôs Clemson fan is chefs kiss.,3
"""Leave the game before the game leaves you, Dabo""",2
2025 Clemson = 2024 FSU,0
if Syracuse loses this its officially seppuku time,3
will clemson fall to 1-3? people are asking,3
That doesn't look too bad on the QB.  Looked like everyone was covered and he just tried to make a throw.  Still 51 attempts by the QB is just crazy bad balance.,4
All that offseason of hype just to be eliminated from the playoff conversation in September,2
"""Ok, but how does this performance affect Tua‚Äôs legacy?""",4
Kinda feel for Clemson fans. They know things aren‚Äôt going in the right direction but they can‚Äôt call for a coaching change.,3
Good lord in heaven Clemson is ass,1
Syracuse &gt;&gt;&gt; LSU,6
Ha ha clemson suck it!  <em>You have your turn on us tonight</em>,3
"""Now that the SEC has moved to 9 games, I think Clemson would fit in well in the conference. We still want to have a late November cupcake on the schedule""",2
People blaming Klubnik for this game are idiots. He‚Äôs actually playing pretty well. Our problems offensively go way deeper than QB play,3
Shoutout to #1 preseason best team in America Clemson for going 1-3,1
Tech rushed the field last week haha,3
2025 Clemson = 2024 FSU,0
This Clemson QB is the one people were saying would win the Heisman??? LMFAOOOO,2
Clemson downgraded to non life threatening injury valley,3
Haha Clemson. Imagine being ranked top 5 in the preseason rankings and having an enormously disappointing QB who nevertheless inexplicably has NFL draft hype. Couldn‚Äôt be me right üò¨,3
You held a three man rush? Lol lol lol,3
I dont know if yall just saw that allstate commercial but the georgia fan barking at his boss in the meeting had me wheezing it was so hilarious,4
And that's pretty much it folks. The fall of Clemson needs to be studied. Dabo might actually get his wish.,0
Is this Clemsoning v 2.0?,3
"""Hell yeah, patented Dabo """"just throw the ball up and hope your guy comes up with it"""" offense.""",3
I‚Äôm starting to think Clemson can no longer claim ‚ÄúDeath Valley‚Äù,3
Dude in the back really flexing those calves with the Khaki shorts,4
has anyone heard what channel we will be on after the delay?,4
JOHNTAY!!!,5
Is his FG range that close to the 20 lol,3
these syracuses injuries are brutal,4
2 5-star QB whiffs in a row,3
Not like that...,3
I think he broke his leg,4
When it rains,4
so is clemson this year‚Äôs FSU?,2
"""‚ÄúBob, they just need to get some more commercials in.‚Äù""",4
Damn Angeli,3
"""GUNDY, DABO, MCDANIELS  FMK??""",3
Klubnik might be the best worst qb ever,3
Why. the fuck. aren‚Äôt we running,3
what the fuck Cade,2
That's the call? Shheesyut,3
What's ThatBoy's contract looking like?  Didn't they just re-up him?,3
So if and when Dabo departs who's up for the job?,4
Our ST look so much better than previous years,5
No way Clemson is this bad.,3
I am now not too impressed with Georgia techs win,3
Trampled By Turtles on at Farm Aid 40. Always good‚Ä¶.,4
Perfect spiral.,5
They‚Äôre lettin these boys play on the outside damn,3
I'd imagine they're just deciding they'll take the DPI rather than a completion but they're not getting called for it lol,4
They are probably going to need Collins to make a few plays at this point.,3
Horrible coverage there,2
Sheesh.,5
Ooof that missed tackle,3
Syracuse don‚Äôt screw this up just burn some of the clock,4
Really needed to make that tackle smh,3
I can‚Äôt imagine dudes named jontay being anything but awesome,5
Jaedyn lukas is a terrorist,3
Even if we get the ball it'll take us 5 minutes of game clock to score (if we do),2
Hmm. Interesting strategy Cuse.,5
I thought Syracuse would have a down year with Collins and thought they got way better when Angeli transferred there. Brutal,5
The issue is that Clemson has looked much better on the ground,3
"""Come on oranges, your juice is my favorite pull this out""",4
dude just go for the first,4
Klubnik has 300 yards and 3 td‚Äôs‚Ä¶I have not watched any of this game is that misleading or is he actually playing well,1
Please punt here Dabo. I want to hear the boos,3
I would like to point out games that started after this are reaching halftime or are in the 3rd quarter,4
That was an ugly toss,3
PICKED,4
Incredible,5
YESO,5
"""LOL. lmao, even""",3
There it is!,5
<h1>LMAO</h1>,2
Cade really regressed over the summer. Sigh.,1
Gorgeous INT,3
That wasn‚Äôt good,3
"""That'll be game, boys.""",1
game,1
It wasn‚Äôt necessary but a pick fits Klubnik‚Äôs day,4
"""Get off your knees, Cade""",3
Oh thank you phew,5
How many games are we going to let this bum ass qb lose for us,1
"""Few things in sports are more demoralizing as playing on a bad football team, except being a bad football team that begins a program tailspin""",0
Oh god the 1/8th of the fans left are getting out of here,0
Not the best throw but i dont think anyone was really open anyway. Maybe the slant from the right but i think the lb was picking it up.,3
In Fran we trust!,6
"""They gotta stop calling for teams to cover against clemson, it's clearly a massive curse""",0
Why are they throwing the ball?,2
GIVE ME JOHN GRUDEN,5
Welcome to Clemson Mike Gundy,4
I am very excited for this post game press conference.,5
Time management is Cristobalian,4
Finally found a stream to watch this game.,5
Syracuse giving Clemson so many opportunities to come back,3
Bro. Run the fucking ball. Fucking Christ.,2
"""I can confidently say, Mario would have ran the ball every single down the last 6 times lol.""",3
Nebraska better be scared. We are coming for their ‚Äúmost one score losses in a season‚Äù record,0
If Dabo ends up retiring/leaving within the next couple of years I can‚Äôt think of a better guy to bring in to keep the program in a good spot,4
I do like how they keep blitzing. Not running the last 2 drives is wild though,3
That arm isn't beating anybody.,3
Obviously part of it is prevent defense giving stuff up but our offense is so much better when we're actually moving with a little bit of tempo and can get in a rhythm. The playcalling holds us back so much and has for years,1
"""What happened to Cade? He looks like he took a few hits that broke his confidence.<br/> He has nervous feet, like a QB who was thrown to the wolves.""",0
Over/under number of Clemson players headed to the portal,3
Garrett riley even looked disgusted,3
"""Hell yeah, Orange Stanford!""",3
So is this rock bottom for Dabo?,1
WTF was that throw.,3
Maybe the big ten is on to something about punting. This whole going for it on 4th down isn‚Äôt working out,3
Dabo better call thunder down from heaven in this post conference talk,4
Nixon at speed is a goddamn bulldozer,5
Heh,4
I blame this on Ian Scheffilen,3
"""Nah I‚Äôm not paying 30 for that espn, fuck off""",4
"""I may have read the rules wrong, but I'm relatively sure that if Syracuse holds on (looking increasingly likely after that pick), Clemson has to give up the color orange.   That's why Syracuse is mainly wearing white, you see, as they had lost the last time they played.""",2
"""Made decent money betting on Syracuse to cover. Didn‚Äôt think they would win, but knew the line was way too big seeing Clemson is pathetic. I just need USC to cover and my parlay will be good for this week""",3
Yall yelling  about Cuse throwing the ball. They‚Äôre trying to get their backup reps. And Cade hasn‚Äôt done jack shit. This game is over,3
Can someone loop me in on what a Clemson is? Why the school named that,4
Does Clemson even finish 500?,4
I think Clemson was a little overrated in the preseason rankings.,2
"""Just not gonna call that holding, eh?""",4
Hand it off!,3
The emptiness in the stands is kind of jarring. The game is definitely not over. Wild,1
YES!,6
Sucks we probably won't win another game considering we now have no QB,1
Finally! The return of Clemsoning!,4
"""Look just know when your coach starts answering with his decades long accomplishments to a question that was never asked, you‚Äôre on the descent.""",1
How is the world is this game still going on????,2
I love the barking commercial,4
"""How long do programs gotta keep guys like Gundy and Dabo around? Like, thanks for everything but also how long do you let the guy who built the program actually tear it back down?""",1
"""Clemson is an acc bottomfeeder, always has been, no I will not look at the last 12 years of football history""",3
Dabo a fraud,2
So which big program do we think is gonna hire Fran Brown after this season?,4
"""Poor Syracuse, despite taking us to the cleaners, seems to have some serious issues with conditioning. How many injuries have they had now?""",2
Waiting for FSU - Clemson tickets to drop so I can go see a good team play in South Carolina for once,1
Just goes to show how quickly you can go from top 10 program to an empty stadium at Home when you coach is a stubborn boomer,2
Just smacked the DB in the face mask lmao,4
That might be the quietest crowd i‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs dead silent.,2
lmao holding his arm and no flag,4
why wasnt syracuse tackling him?,3
Too little too late,3
I see the I formation and I jizz my shorts. Can‚Äôt help it. Wont apologize for it.,4
"""just saw this, is dabo getting fired""",3
Kirby Smart disciple Fran Brown üòé,4
Have to wonder if Angeli's condition is why they are giving the backup some reps throwing,4
this mf is so ass üò≠,3
Holding.,4
Clemson has a couple easy games coming up at least. No way they lose to UNC or BC,5
"""So, when Bama inevitably runs Deboer out of town, is Fran Brown the new favorite for the job?""",4
Lmao. That‚Äôs the worst offensive holding non-call I‚Äôve ever seen.,3
We're definitely losing this game,2
CFB fans and hyping up a mediocre QB. Name a better duo. Yall do not know ball at all,2
Block in the backs legal now?,4
Come on Clempson. Fire him.,2
LFG!!!!!,6
so if worst case scenario angeli is out for the season can he redshirt?,4
Dabo needs to put in Ian schifflein,5
Upheld!,5
tom allen is your issue. your welcome,3
I say it again: because that‚Äôs all we‚Äôve done is win‚Ä¶,5
Is belfor the replacement for fema???,4
Let Tyler from Spartanburg cook,0
They do know you're supposed to grab them not give them back pats? lol,3
i‚Äôm scared,4

Rickie Collins is not good so this will be interesting how Syracuse tries to ice this one,3
"""To think 90% of the pre season mock drafts had Arch, Cade and Allar as top 5 picks lol""",2
Did Syracuse‚Äôs 2nd string qb get injured?,4
That doesn‚Äôt stop the clock at all anymore,4
yeah clemson isn‚Äôt scoring through the air anyway.,3
Catch if sapp doesnt just stop running for some reason,4
it's over,3
Now run the ball,5
"""Alright, Orange. 3 more pass plays?""",5
Lmao,4
"""Well, then there‚Äôs that.""",3
GO ORANGE!!!,5
OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!,2
holy shit,3
That was pretty nasty damn,5
"""Someone called that earlier.. Identify yourself and give me powerball numbers, you beautiful bastard!!""",5
No passes  Only runs  Do not fuck this up,5
Game over,3
i think u have to throw it here if ur syracuse,5
RIP,3
Kade‚Äôs face was perfect,3
"""Run the ball, drain clock, play defense""",5
What game do i watch now? :/ Michigan?,4
Honestly Cade just sails the ball in crucial moments,3
"""Idk if I‚Äôm crazy or just cynical but it feels like the QB draft class for the next couple years are in a terrible, terrible position. Like backup NFL material at best""",3
I am very happy with this,5
I don‚Äôt understand. Why not run the ball? Is syracuse fucking braindead,2
Great punt,5
Come on get a safety!,5
The fucking balls on cuse,3
The creative blitzing and pressure on the QB has been something to watch this game.,4
Deep ball incoming,4
Keys to victory lol,5
woof,4
"""Sharpen the axe Neff, theres changes afoot!""",5
This is a crazy timeline,3
Wesco will transfer to LSU,3
Who do Clemson fans have in mind for their next coach?,1
At least Randall was gonna get tackled short so i cant be that mad at it. I dont know how theres that many people coming through unblocked that quick,3
Damn straight buns,3
Klubnik has thrown 60 passes,3
lol what was that,3
(Cries) ‚ÄúGo Toros‚Ä¶‚Äù,3
"""What kind of man goes by """"Dabo"""". I mean seriously  Edit: Y'all can downvote me all you want. He has a weird ass name""",3
Clemson fans are pathetic. I'm a Georgia alum but I almost want them to win just so he 80k fans who left early can have the shame they deserve,3
"""Dabo Swinney, go ahead and start shopping for properties in Thailand or South America. You will be retiring pal.""",2
Are Clemson fans tired of all the winning yet?,1
I‚Äôm wheezing üò≠üò≠üò≠ this is like a movie bro,3
Does Dabo get Tarmac‚Äôd at home?,3
Those stands empty   They have no faith in the home team lmao (i know there was a huge delay),1
You would think getting your butt whooped by a coach from a Kirby coaching tree that started 10 years after you when your coaching tree has been a disaster would humble you but‚Ä¶probably not,2
Klubnik's pocket presence has been pretty nice in Q4 tbh,5
Thats dpi dude come on. His left arm is being held the whole time,5
I don't understand why there's not some sort of review booth that watches all plays for missed penalties. Pretty sure ufl does it,4
I cannot wait for Dabo‚Äôs postgame life lesson after this one.,3
Using those timeouts would've been incompetent if Syracuse had good coaches but,4
I hate the new clock rules,3
Selfish play - just knock it down on 4th.,4
It's never been more Dabover,0
Props to the homie that totally called that Klubnik int like 2 mins ago,3
SYRACUSE -17.5 LIVE???,5
This is like watching the last 3 minutes of a basketball game,3
I know this is completely not the right place to bring this up but I cut my ear (tragus). No idea how and it's bleeding like when you cut yourself shaving. I'm almost considering going to urgent care lol.,4
Damn‚Ä¶gonna be a lot of Confederate flags at 1/2 mast today.,0
People downvoting the fake injury claims like Syracuse didnt do the same shit against tennessee and these injuries all have super convinient timing,4
CLEMSON LMAAAAOOOOOOOO,5
The fucking worst pass protection I‚Äôve ever seen,3
"""Two hamstrings cramp at the same time, huh?""",2
[removed],4
lol these refs,3
I hate to be that guy but 3-4 of syracuses stops for injuries have halted drives that had momentum,4
"""Eh, he didn‚Äôt have control""",4
Take the points wtf are you doing,3
Game,3
Is dabo getting fired if he misses a bowl game?,2
Iv been watching Michigan and Nebraska. Has Dabo and Clemson been just as bad this half as they were in the first? I mean obviously the score.. but how‚Äôs it been? Iv missed so much shit talking,2
Good,4
Clempson gon win,5
"""that throw was fine, he was just locked down""",5
