But every week as you’re getting on the rollercoaster you think to yourself, “No way it’s this good again, no sir. I talked to the owner, and he swears the endless-blessing feature is still in.” And sometimes you’ll crest the first hill with a grin and think you’re a genius. Sometimes you’ll even make it 95% of the way through the ride still high-fiving strangers and smelling like victory. And you’re right, because you <em>are</em> safe.  As your little car glides toward the finish, you hear a noise. The wind seems to whisper, “Wahoowa, legend.” A tiny golden hand pops out and gently pats you on the back again and again. Like the universe itself is saying “well played.”  Mercy isn’t needed here; triumph is the only dialect spoken. As you feel the champagne you were drinking sparkle in your throat, the last thought flitting through your mind before the sweet glow of satisfaction wipes out all other sensations is, “I bet next week when I ride this coaster, I’ll win <em>again</em>.” You magnificent genius.",
