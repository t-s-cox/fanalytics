1758407790.0,Dabo Haters have been waiting for this day.  Will he bounce back?  Find out next time on CFBall Z!
1758406439.0,Reporter should ask Dabo about 'clemsoning' in the post game presser.  Reprise of the question many years ago just to watch him freak out and go off.    Oh man I would pay to see that!
1758406402.0,Did Dabo give either half a grade in the post conference?
1758405779.0,Feel sorry for UNC. My bet is Clemson hangs 50-60 in Chapel Bill. They are not very good on D or O. Losing 27-3 early in 3rd to UCF.
1758405524.0,17.5 point underdog won in Death Valley on a must-win for desperate Clemson. This was no fluke. Syracuse never trailed. Won by nearly two TD‚Äôs. Even their backup QB scored. Ouch. Made ‚ÄòCuse look like a top 29-30 team.
1758405517.0,Dabo is a ü§°
1758405033.0,"Somewhere Scott Shafer is yelling ‚ÄúFuck you, Dabo‚Äù"
1758404950.0,"How do you even grade this one Dabo??  Syracuse manhandled you in your own house on all sides of the ball, even special teams. You had your guys analyze film during the weather delay and they still came out looking terrible.  Season defining loss and all around failure for Clemson that has to force big changes. Wishing all the best to Angeli for a speedy recovery and hope for a thriller rest of the season for Fran Brown and the Orange!"
1758404756.0,I'm betting Texas Tech to win it all
1758404679.0,LSU on fraud watch. their only big wins were (fraudulently ranked) Clemson and Florida. 0 indications they‚Äôre the #3 team in the country
1758404614.0,Well Clemson you should get a win after the bye. You play the one ACC team worse than you the Belichick's
1758404543.0,If Troy closed Clemson would be 0-4 üò≠üò≠
1758404401.0,We‚Äôre about to get a master class in gaslighting from Dabo LOL.
1758404392.0,Dabo is a relic of the pre NIL era.
1758404372.0,"I'll never get over FSU basically pulling a backdoor firing of Bobby Bowden after a string of 7 win seasons, and Dabo, you're no Bowden."
1758404345.0,Syracuse is the only orange team I can like. All other oranges teams are bad
1758404345.0,gg Tigers
1758404344.0,Does God hate Clemson now?
1758404337.0,I don‚Äôt really feel bad for dabo. Should I?
1758404335.0,"On the plus side, Fran is going to shower today!"
1758404332.0,"If we can should fire Dabo bc we are tired of winning, what should be do if we‚Äôre tired of losing."
1758404318.0,Good win for Syracuse. Had this penciled in as a loss. Big win given how tough their schedule is with Miami and Notre Dame remaining among other teams.
1758404303.0,Dabo is so cooked
1758404289.0,Dabo is the cringiest coach in college football
1758404289.0,Dabo retirement game

1758404233.0,Dabo in tears is always a beautiful sight.
1758404231.0,Clemsoning is officially back
1758404229.0,"It's been obvious for years Clemson is constantly falling apart without all-universe QBs like Watson and Lawrence, these people will NEVER learn.   If Swinney isn't fired by tomorrow morning, there is blackmail going on between him and the AD"
1758404226.0,Is Dabo crying?
1758404225.0,Dabo looks like he's legit about to cry.
1758404221.0,Dabo looks like he finna cry
1758404212.0,God can‚Äôt save you from the media now Dabo
1758404210.0,"This is random, but the amount of deputies teams carry with them now is comically absurd.  Running 5-7 deep for each head coach is insane"
1758404208.0,Joe Fortenbaugh on ESPN bet live 2 best bets for the college football season were  Clemson over 9.5 wins - that bet has already lost 4 games into the season   Cal under 4.5 wins - Cal is 3-0 and favored by 2 TD's today vs San Diego St
1758404195.0,rickie collins what do you have for me‚Ä¶
1758404193.0,"Clemson continues to die its slow death following ""the catch"" in the 2019 Fiesta Bowl."
1758404192.0,This game should officially mark the end of questioning if clemson is able to turn it around and get back to national championship form. Thats gone until further notice and we should not be given reporting news other than local teams
1758404190.0,Love Fran for the orange. Hope he stays there a long time
1758404189.0,Congratulations Syracuse!  You all beat our tails for 4 quarters. Protect Fran Brown at all costs!

1758404168.0,"It just seems unnecessarily mean to comment other than to say Clemson fans, watch our game later and we'll make you feel better."
1758404164.0,Fear the Orange!
1758404163.0,"my god, they actually did it. never thought we'd be the ones to cast Clempus into the fires of hell, but god damn does it feel good."
1758404156.0,"Look at <a href=""https://247sports.com/season/2025-football/collegeteamtalentcomposite/"">this</a> and tell me talent is the issue and that the portal would fix Clemson.   The portal has maybe 3 players a year that could start for Clemson (and that‚Äôs assuming they pick Clemson over the 20 other schools courting them)  Dabo needs to coach better."
1758404146.0,Let‚Äôs go Orange! üçä
1758404141.0,Fran out there recruiting for next year's transfer portal
1758404139.0,Clemson about to get dog walked by the media

1758404126.0,And the season is over for cLemson in September
1758404125.0,Everyone wave goodbye‚Ä¶.üëãüëã.
1758404120.0,CLEMPSON LOST
1758404119.0,"Doesn't it seem like Clemson's fallen apart after Venables left? Meanwhile, Sooners are looking better than ever under Venables. Maybe it was always Venables?"
1758404115.0,What grade would you give Syracuse today Dabo
1758404112.0,First time so far.
1758404110.0,Is Dabo gonna get the Richt treatment if he doesn‚Äôt shake things up?
1758404106.0,"Come on, field goal on 1st down as time expires."
1758404106.0,"I wonder how long it takes for Dabo to get that smug smirk on his face, ""I think we can afford a couple of dang stinkers, after all this winning we're used to. I promise I don't read the criticism even though I complain about it every season."""
1758404103.0,Post game thread should have been up 10 minutes ago
1758404099.0,Fuck espn for how many ads they ran this second half when they had that long ass rain delay to run ads
1758404098.0,Get fucked dabo
1758404095.0,I missed his injury what did he do? ankle?
1758404091.0,"Im ready for austin, the rock, and undertaker to go in there and drop the rock bottom,  stone cold stunner, and choke slam on this whole coaching staff"
1758404089.0,Dabo just needs to own this disaster.
1758404084.0,WOOHOOOO
1758404083.0,"Tyler from Spartanburg, it‚Äôs your time to shine once again"
1758404077.0,I really feel awful for Syracuse QB. Hopefully he gets better fast dude is a dog
1758404076.0,GG
1758404076.0,"Wonder who Dabo will blame this time   Maybe he finally does the right thing and takes the blame  Eh who am I kidding, he‚Äôll throw some walk on practice dude under the bus for not emulating Syracuses backup te well enough in practice"
1758404076.0,Aaaand unclench
1758404074.0,Remind me why Clemson was ranked top 5 in preseason?
1758404071.0,"You know, I wish more teams in the ACC tried to carry their weight. When little country schools like Clemson, who don't care about football, get the same share of the conference pie, that's a problem. That's why Cuse is trying to go to the SEC."
1758404069.0,It's September 20 and Clemson effectively is out of the ACC title race
1758404068.0,GG
1758404062.0,i remember thinking the first half against troy was an exception but now i think the second half was
1758404062.0,They should take all the post game questions from the Clemson message boards.
1758404061.0,Hey Clemson that's how you make a 4th down conversion
1758404054.0,It's not even the fact that we're 1-3  We look absolutely terrible
1758404052.0,"Dabo is running the program to compete in yesteryears game. The game has changed and you cannot cheat the game. Look at any mid to upper echelon program. They're faster, meaner and quite frankly significantly better than our squad. The head man cannot go on National TV and whine while he's cheating the game. This season's results say much more than all the talk."
1758404049.0,FATALITY
1758404044.0,Could the acc send two teams to the CFP?
1758404040.0,Lost in the lol Dabo of this is that Fran had them fired up and put a good plan together.
1758404038.0,How is this game still on?
1758404034.0,"Nice, we won"
1758404033.0,games back right on time bye guys
1758404030.0,"Can someone ELI5/OOTL me who in the fuck ""Tyler from Spartanburg"" is?"
1758404028.0,"Sometimes I feel like im watching a different game. The last missed throw to Randall was kinda bad and the one to the middle over Moore was a real bad miss too but Klubnik consistently has no time to throw.  And moore has zero room to be mad about anything, dropped 2 huge plays and never gets open."
1758404015.0,ESPN: Clemson might be the best team in the country! Arch Manning will win the Heisman!  Im starting to think maybe ESPN just wants clicks?
1758404013.0,syracuse isnt fucking around now. saving the extra second ü§£
1758404012.0,"I just want a <del>Gundy</del> Dabo, ""I'm a man"" speech after this."
1758404008.0,This is the crappiest Clemson football I've seen since the end of the Bowden days
1758404008.0,"Welp, who had Clemson going 1-3 to start the year? I sure as hell didn‚Äôt LOLü§£"
1758404002.0,You can watch us get our shit kicked in for free at 7 instead!
1758404002.0,Just saw someone fall to their knees in a Cookout
1758404001.0,"I'd say ""rank Syracuse you cowards"" but given how Clemson played this game I don't think it's that impressive a win."
1758403936.0,Isn‚Äôt Dabo the one that said if Clemson is tired of winning they can fire him?
1758403979.0,Clemson really staring 1-3 right in the eyes
1758403920.0,Don‚Äôt forget - this team is not that far from 0-4  Troy had them on the ropes
1758403982.0,"We should be 0-4, the Troy win was a fluke. Screw this whole team they clearly don't care about anything anymore"
1758403224.0,This game would be over if we just ran it both those third downs
1758403447.0,Crazy to think Clemson and VT will have the same record
1758403957.0,No lighting delay this team is probably 0-4 losing to Troy
1758403877.0,"He was right, 1-2 isn't that bad. 1-3 is much worse"
1758403915.0,"What Dabo's narrative should be after the game: ""We need to start looking internally because things aren't clicking like they used to and we need to make changes and that's on me."" But that won't be his narrative."
1758403735.0,It‚Äôs Dabover
1758403809.0,"<h1>FACT</h1>  Clemson issue is <strong>NOT</strong> the portal, they are ranked NUMBER 7 in the team talent composite.   The issue is that they do not develop good players anymore, and the offensive game plan is comically bad.   For example, they have a higher team talent composite than A&amp;M, ND, Florida Tennessee. USC  IT IS NOT THE PORTAL the coaching is terrible"
1758403938.0,"Can't wait to see Dabo gaslight after this one. ""You guys are spoiled, I'm still not going to the beach!"""
1758403949.0,"Dabo obviously shouldn't be fired, but he should <em>absolutely</em> be under an enormous amount of pressure to make serious changes.  And if he stubbornly refuses... Then the seat's gotta start getting warm. Especially if Clemson wins up not being bowl eligible, and that's on the table after today."
1758403388.0,So whats the main sports radio call in show for Clemson football?
1758403874.0,can't wait for this presser
1758403876.0,‚Äúwhat will the next narrative be from their head coach?‚Äù commentators calling Dabo out lol
1758403053.0,Cade Turndaballova Uiagalelei
1758403438.0,guys i think they‚Äôre gonna pass
1758403763.0,3-17 on third and fourth downs. üíÄ
1758403920.0,The post-game presser is gonna be wild.
1758403827.0,I need to hear from Tyler from Spartanburg after this game
1758403890.0,Lmao these commentators are not holding backüòÇ
1758403927.0,Can't wait to see the two fans that meet at the paw
1758403935.0,Can't wait to hear Dabo blame everyone but Dabo.
1758402988.0,Damn so Clemson stinks
1758403433.0,Damn prevent defense
1758403539.0,"""Dabo sucks, he was only good because of hiring decisions and recruiting.""  (There was an era where those were more important than NIL or the portal)."
1758403769.0,Syracuse not fucking the running the ball there ended up not mattering because Clemson is just that much of a fuckup.
1758403833.0,"To be fair, a 1-3 start is WAY worse than a 1-2 start. So Dabo was right"
1758403896.0,I hope Klubnik picked a useful degree because at this rate he‚Äôs not going to be suiting up in the NFL
1758403907.0,Cade and Arch couldn't start a community college flag football game
1758403938.0,Can we please see Vizzina next game? Cade just ain't it  What's the worst that can happen? Cade gets his feelings hurt and doesn't play well if he comes back in?  He ain't playing well now
1758403977.0,Dabo is now concentrating on his post game presser.
1758403060.0,EXTEND FRAN BROWN
1758403202.0,I understand wanting to give him reps but just run the damn ball
1758403657.0,"I hope the ""I woke up feeling the cheesiest, coach!"" commercial never goes away. It's been a daily vocal stim for years at this point."
1758403740.0,"Klubnik is caught in that great area where he is struggling with accuracy, and then his receivers are dropping it when he is actually accurate."
1758403757.0,"""fuck it someone has to be down there"" -Clemson on 3rd and 4th downs"
1758403830.0,Clemson catching an L on their bye week from the Dabo presser where he blames the culture in America and toxic expectations for why this is happening
1758403873.0,‚ÄúWell dagnabbit I guess I‚Äôll just take my lil‚Äô ol‚Äô self somewhere else. I won‚Äôt be sittin‚Äô on no lil‚Äô ol‚Äô beach goshdarnit. I‚Äôll take myself to some other school to hoodwink them with my antiquated approach in the new world of college football.‚Äù
1758403889.0,Couldn't happen to a more unlikeable coach.
1758403901.0,And this is why preseason rankings are a joke.
1758403917.0,"WWE on ESPN is weird, y‚Äôall"
1758403920.0,"This team is ass, bro"
1758403970.0,God I love these serious legit sports commentators having to hype silly fake wrasslin
1758403043.0,"We really need to move on from Cade. Seasons over, he isn‚Äôt putting points up. Get some one some reps for next season"
1758403199.0,Run the damn clock to end the game already.
1758403349.0,Clemson is still holding like crazy.
1758403537.0,Tigernet probably about to break
1758403600.0,Northeast needs a major college team. There are some potential contenders but Cuse is the only one with tradition. I hope this is the start of their climb. Hopefully they have rich boosters.
1758403728.0,This whole game has been Cade having pressure in his face and him heaving the ball up.
1758403762.0,"Big if, but if this beating serves as a wake-up call for Clemson, we'd owe Fran Brown twice."
1758403778.0,Put Clemson out of their misery already. It‚Äôs been 5 1/2 hours of putrid football on their end.
1758403800.0,Well Clemson fans see you at 7:00 for our turn to get killed
1758403857.0,üüßüüßüüß
1758403904.0,Why can‚Äôt we have a win that doesn‚Äôt get laughed off afterwards
1758403947.0,Can we use the tariff money to pay for Dabos buyout?
1758403964.0,Why is God not orchestrating a Clemson comeback?
1758403935.0,"Prediction: Billy Napier is fired in the locker room after getting demolished by Miami. Florida boosters call Clemson boosters, pay Dabo‚Äôs buyout clause, and Dabo is your next Florida head coach."
1758403515.0,Dabo‚Äôs team has given up on him.
1758403643.0,I will 100% bark at my boss on a Saturday.
1758403722.0,Lmao at Clemson doing both of their keys to the game and still getting wallopped
1758403752.0,Alright i wanna see three passes here syracuse
1758403781.0,"Dabo, hopefully this is the ass kicking needed to get on with the times"
1758403848.0,"What will Dabo's excuses be post-game? It isn't his fault, we do know that."
1758403868.0,Kinda sad to see death valley turn into just another place to play
1758403910.0,"Serious question, wasn't Klubnik the preseason heisman favorite?"
1758403944.0,This game film is going to flag Dabo‚Äôs Covenant Eyes with the pounding Cuse gave them
1758403973.0,John Cena vs Bork Laser. What is this 2010
1758402721.0,that was a terrible play call on a down and distance you arent going to pick up anyway.
1758403047.0,Trevor Lawrence legacy grows by the day
1758403168.0,Why would you throw it there? The hell???
1758403370.0,"There are at least 30 other quarterbacks I would take before Cade Klubnik, and I am 100% under-estimating that number. He is actually awful. DJU was bad at *some* points, mostly because he let mental stuff get to him. Also he did not have a supporting cast and coaches to help him be his best. Cade isn't bad, he's actually awful."
1758403549.0,If Syracuse wins every team in America should be forced to change their name to a color. Oklahoma state chartreuse has a good ring to it
1758403579.0,I feel like I‚Äôve been watching this game all day
1758403693.0,"Clemson‚Äôs talent issue isn‚Äôt all about the portal  There‚Äôs been a serious lack of development. Adding from the portal can mitigate some of that but the OL, WR (outside of Wesco) and Klubnik are all worse than last year."
1758403751.0,Can‚Äôt believe how empty that stadium is
1758403774.0,0-4 on 4th down in 2nd half lol
1758403839.0,I know there was a long delay but this being a 5.5 hour upset makes me a little bit happier
1758403842.0,Crazy Klubnik was a heisman favorite on a preseason #4 team and now might not even get drafted.
1758403424.0,Oh wow. They called it this time.
1758402707.0,I‚Äôm convinced the Syracuse OC got drunk during the delay because wtf is he doing‚Ä¶
1758403076.0,HEY TYLER
1758403280.0,Does Syracuse now have D line and O line who can hang with the elite physical teams now? This was always their problem.
1758403331.0,I think we've lost as many games at home between last year and now than we did the previous 10 years
1758403381.0,Fran said fuck prevent...
1758403484.0,I guess we‚Äôre the new Tigers now
1758403496.0,Tyler from Spartanburg was fake and set up by Clemson to get the fans riled up. They‚Äôre gonna have to dig DEEP to save this season. They need 5 more wins and it looks like they can‚Äôt even pull that off
1758403555.0,Mike Gundy and his brother Dabo aren't doing so well.
1758403706.0,Klubnik sending out so many hospital balls those recievers going to get ptsd
1758403711.0,Punt it Dabo! Punting is winning!
1758403727.0,If your QB has to throw 60 times in game‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time
1758403741.0,Hes dead Jim.
1758403755.0,that'll do it
1758403770.0,D.A.R.T
1758403772.0,Jesus christ Cade lol
1758403776.0,Cade probably would‚Äôve been a decent draft pick had he left
1758403803.0,"GG Clemson Bros, good luck the rest of the season, always welcome to come hangout in our game threads."
1758403814.0,"To be fair, it‚Äôs not very hard to give Garrett Riley fits"
1758403818.0,People really tried to hype Arch Manning and Cade Klubnik as Heisman candidates lol
1758403818.0,"Dabo's going to be at the podium whining about 2016 until kickoff next week, isn't he?"
1758403824.0,Lmao they're ripping Dabo
1758403845.0,‚ÄúNever been able to settle in.‚Äù Well yeah because Cade sucks. I really don‚Äôt understand why Dabo refuses to put in the back up. He did the same shit with DJ U.
1758403852.0,"2018 Dabo: ""The BEST Is Yet to Come""  Well, we're still waiting on that coach"
1758403857.0,"If Cade Klubnik is the starter next game, Dabo has officially given up and is just laughing all the way to the bank knowing he's going to get his money regardless of the results of this season. Cade is worse now than DJ U was (with a much worse OC too) and I will not be gaslit into pretending otherwise."
1758403868.0,60 attempts... with 16 carries by your running back.... wild
1758403881.0,"Cade really just chucks it over and over. I can‚Äôt remember watching another QB that felt less accurate in his throws. Like, it seems like literally half of them are uncatchable out of bounds."
1758403903.0,Randall averaged 8.1 yards a carry but hey throw it 60 times and only run it 16
1758403926.0,Does this make Clemson the 2024 FSU of 2025? ü§î
1758403926.0,When does the christmas tree show up outside Dabos house
1758403079.0,klubnik is cheeeeeeks damn
1758403209.0,Luckily it doesn't matter what Syracuse does because Clemson sucks so much
1758403329.0,Syracuse is not running to give the Clemson Board more reasons‚Ä¶
1758403580.0,Only saw before the rain delay. Wiiild.
1758403667.0,Walhburg on a Bruce Willis run with the b tier movies before he retires
1758403695.0,Now too many teams are ranked higher because of a bad Clemson team that is 1-3 lol
1758403772.0,Both teams would be in the locker room if Syracuse had any semblance of clock management

1758403890.0,The dabo fever dream ends
1758403910.0,Sad lil Dabo
1758403967.0,pretty disastrous start to clemsons season
1758403975.0,Go for it.
1758403527.0,Why is Dabo so scared to always do what needs to be done with the personnel? When is someone going to tell him God doesn't have a favorite football team?
1758403717.0,Most coaches would take the post game a chance to apologize to the fanbase. Dabos head is so far up his own butt he will just throw people under the bus
1758403863.0,"Watson was a dud, TLaw looks like a dud and now Klubnik looks like he was all hype. Clemson QBs on my perpetual do not draft list"

1758403258.0,Why does every pass take 3-4 seconds to develop
1758403275.0,"Did the commentator already forgot about the interception? It was essentially a turnover on downs, but still."
1758403332.0,Clubnik not doing well under pressure it seems lol
1758403481.0,Can we even do deep passing plays anymore or do they all have to be line of scrimmage?
1758403518.0,"Well, at least we still have enough prestige that our opponents will rush the field (when playing at our stadium at least)"

1758403771.0,And that's pretty much it folks. The fall of Clemson needs to be studied. Dabo might actually get his wish.
1758403034.0,"Few things in sports are more demoralizing as playing on a bad football team, except being a bad football team that begins a program tailspin"
1758403039.0,Oh god the 1/8th of the fans left are getting out of here
1758403051.0,Not the best throw but i dont think anyone was really open anyway. Maybe the slant from the right but i think the lb was picking it up.
1758403065.0,In Fran we trust!
1758403790.0,"What happened to Cade? He looks like he took a few hits that broke his confidence.<br/> He has nervous feet, like a QB who was thrown to the wolves."
1758403797.0,Over/under number of Clemson players headed to the portal
1758403801.0,Garrett riley even looked disgusted
1758403801.0,"Hell yeah, Orange Stanford!"
1758403806.0,So is this rock bottom for Dabo?
1758403807.0,WTF was that throw.
1758403809.0,Maybe the big ten is on to something about punting. This whole going for it on 4th down isn‚Äôt working out
1758403854.0,Dabo better call thunder down from heaven in this post conference talk
1758403890.0,Nixon at speed is a goddamn bulldozer

1758403489.0,How is the world is this game still going on????
1758403568.0,I love the barking commercial
1758403636.0,"How long do programs gotta keep guys like Gundy and Dabo around? Like, thanks for everything but also how long do you let the guy who built the program actually tear it back down?"
1758402992.0,Dabo a fraud
1758403478.0,Waiting for FSU - Clemson tickets to drop so I can go see a good team play in South Carolina for once
1758403486.0,Clemson has a couple easy games coming up at least. No way they lose to UNC or BC
1758402910.0,Catch if sapp doesnt just stop running for some reason
1758403119.0,Honestly Cade just sails the ball in crucial moments
1758403135.0,"Idk if I‚Äôm crazy or just cynical but it feels like the QB draft class for the next couple years are in a terrible, terrible position. Like backup NFL material at best"
1758403148.0,I am very happy with this

1758403767.0,I know this is completely not the right place to bring this up but I cut my ear (tragus). No idea how and it's bleeding like when you cut yourself shaving. I'm almost considering going to urgent care lol.
1758403109.0,Iv been watching Michigan and Nebraska. Has Dabo and Clemson been just as bad this half as they were in the first? I mean obviously the score.. but how‚Äôs it been? Iv missed so much shit talking
1757427621.0,Cade Klubnik has proven he has the grit to lead a team to a tenacious comeback against   <em>checks notes</em>  Troy University.
1757426985.0,Defense is back to being psycho killers. Offense went back to 1957.
1757426959.0,Much needed win against a solid opponent. Guaranteed Iowa is already trying to buy our punter. Chiles is showing tons of progress.

1757426759.0,WE beat Liberty
1757427467.0,Tired of being the spooky team that gives the big school a scare. Glad we‚Äôre finally getting some of those statement wins.  Praying this week goes like the last time #18 USF faced off against #5.
1757427261.0,"The Matt Patricia experiment seems to be going well, only giving up 7 total points in 2 games."
1757426987.0,[removed]
1757427633.0,We played a stinker of a game on offense and still won 34-0. Could be worse.
1757427146.0,The second and thrid string played well when we put them in.
1757428096.0,After many years of disappointments we seem to have finally figured out how to win one score games.

1757427851.0,Ohio State: 70 points.  Iowa: 70 forward passing yards.
1757427759.0,LESSSSSSGOOOOOOOOO  Destroyed Gardner-Webb as we damn well should‚Äôve and SP+ has us beating Clemson this weekend. Go Jackets
1757428514.0,"We‚Äôre 2 and 0 and look like an actual football team again. I still have no expectations, and we could easily lose the rest of them. I have had fun so far though and that counts."
1757428965.0,Our young QB and defense look great.
1757427482.0,Covered the spread against BYE
1757428117.0,"Not only did we give kU hopes of victory just to crush their soul, our fans showed out and made it clear we never stopped hating kansas.  This game was a showcase example of why college football thrives on tradition and passion. Hopefully AD‚Äôs across the country took notice."
1757427483.0,"First shutout since 2009. Most amount of yards in a single game since Bo was fired. Backup QB had more yards in just over a quarter than Iowa‚Äôs starting QB has all season. Student section was there an hour before the game. Student section was there throughout the beat down. Big time recruits loved the performance and atmosphere.  Best weekend we‚Äôve had in a long, long time."
1757428236.0,"Rough start, but then looked pretty solid.¬† Still nervous moving into the teeth of the schedule, but they've already doubled the win total from last year."
1757427288.0,Run game good
1757427771.0,"Two solid wins. Things to improve on, sure, but we won the games we had to thus far and looked competent doing so. No about the next four before OSU‚Ä¶"
1757427798.0,"Texas Tech, dare I say it, has a good defense. I never thought I‚Äôd see the day."
1757431190.0,Chiles has thrown 5 TDs and 0 INTs. This time last year he was at 3 TDs 5 INTs
1757427503.0,"It‚Äôs Grambling St. but covering a 50+ point spread is always a stretch. Save one errant throw from Sayin, things went about as perfectly as you could ask.   OU hung on to beat WVU. That‚Äôs really all I can ask for but it really felt like it should have been by more. I‚Äôm just glad we won‚Äôt start the season 0-3."
1757427666.0,"The defense really controlled the game again. Not shocking against LA Tech, but after seeing the defense the last few years, it's just such an improvement it's awesome to see it.  Offense looked a lot like how I feared it would in week one. Looks like a group that hasn't spent much time playing together. I trust the leadership of the guys to lock in and get where they need to get to be successful."
1757427811.0,"We didn‚Äôt lose this year!  As good as we‚Äôve been under Kiffin, we har a nasty habit of losing our SEC opener."
1757428018.0,Minnesota: We have a backup QB that's competent too!  Delaware: We didn't piss all over ourselves on national TV against a power conference school.
1757426900.0,2 punt return touchdowns in a game is insane. Vicari Swain has turned into an absolute weapon. Little positive to say about the the team otherwise.
1757428014.0,Played three and a half quarters against the 8th ranked team in the nation before ‚Äúadversity‚Äù was too much to overcome. Still proud as hell
1757428153.0,[deleted]
1757428157.0,Maalik Murphy looked like he was getting the hang of things. He looked a lot better against Fresno then he did against Cal.
1757428550.0,"Defense was improved from Week 1, balanced running attack, and good production from receivers. ¬†Even more importantly, Reed apparently wasn‚Äôt seriously injured."
1757428802.0,The OU DL was on Michigan like a rabid mongoose from the first whistle. In the secondary Guillory had a pretty great game for a true freshman at CB.
1757429975.0,"Last season, OU had 4 completed passes that went 15+ yards in the air. Mateer has 11 so far this season."
1757427476.0,70-0
1757427090.0,We didn‚Äôt lose this week!
1757427519.0,"A Wisconsin backup QB that played with confidence and made accurate throws, even against a much worse opponent, is something I have to applaud because it‚Äôs rare."
1757427591.0,"Lost to the now-14th ranked team in the nation, on the road, by a margin of a 54-yard field goal.   Most Iowa fans consider this a disaster. I think it‚Äôs not too bad. If it wasn‚Äôt ISU, and was Utah or something, maybe it would sit better with the rest of the fan base."
1757427879.0,Lateef is gonna be a fucking <em>dude</em>.  I can‚Äôt tell you the last time I felt this good about our QB room.
1757430192.0,15-1  Let's Fucking Go!!! üí≤üåµüåØüëÜ
1757437102.0,"5 years ago, Illinois would have been in Duke‚Äôs shoes. Mistakes that take away the chance of a win  10 years ago, we wouldn‚Äôt have even had the hope of a chance  The last time we were ranked in the top 10 was for a brief amount of time in 2001.  Call us frauds, I don‚Äôt care. Illinois is ranked #9 in the country. Life is good."
1757428126.0,Upgraded by ‚Äúdowngrading‚Äù at QB
1757427693.0,Tennessee looks good so far. Aguilar looks better than nico which is a huge plus.
1757428333.0,"Pitt did what they were supposed to do against inferior competition, which for Pitt, is not something that normally happens."
1757429547.0,Dylan Lonergan is the truth and gives us a chance of beating any team on our schedule
1757429872.0,No.
1757430715.0,Finally a solid win for State. Still not a great team but there's a some life around the program for the first time in a while.
1757426824.0,"Maiava looks really good. 700 yards and a 6-0 TD-INT, 70%+ completion in two games.  I understand the level of competition. But thats good."
1757428306.0,Mississippi State pulled off a miracle that always happens against us and Oregon took things personally.  What makes that day better is that I'm also an Orioles fan. Can any Dodgers fans remind me what happened that night?
1757428377.0,Run defense absolutely shut down our hated rival (2 yards!) in a game that ended up closer than the final score or stats make it appear.
1757428483.0,Every ball Sayin threw was caught.
1757428489.0,"2-0 for two straight seasons! Hasn‚Äôt happened in a while (since 2015-2016), but we just might be back  The team has learned how to lock in after multiple consecutive errors. I‚Äôd like the turnovers to just stop happening, but it‚Äôs good to see us not crashing and burning when they do.  Graham Knowles may be the best QB in the history of ever (1100+ QBR, do not ask about the sample size)"
1757429380.0,"Vanderbilt proved in week 1 that they can handle business against an FCS opponent the way a Power Conference Team should.  They then proved in week 2 that they can overcome a halftime deficit by making smart adjustments and staying poised...despite being on the road. Hell, the team whooped ass and still <a href=""https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/news/college-football/virginia-tech-grounds-crew-thanks-vanderbilt-for-treatment-of-guest-locker-room/"">had the energy and respect to clean up the locker room</a> after the game.  Very interested to see how they play at South Carolina. Not necessarily expecting a win, but I'm expecting Vandy to be competitive. Clark Lea has built a culture that I cannot ignore. Love what I'm seeing so far..."
1757427941.0,*points to sidebar image*
1757427139.0,"No, no I don‚Äôt think I will"
1757428698.0,"While it wasn‚Äôt pretty, we overcame adversity and our own foot shooting to win a tightly contested in-state rivalry game for the first time at home since <em>2011</em>. Give credit where it‚Äôs due, Iowa always plays us extremely close, regardless of skill differences. Survive and advance is the name of the game with ¬°El √Åssico!"
1757431758.0,We've beaten two rivals and it's not even week 3
1757427210.0,If we keep running the ball like the 2nd half we can win the conference.
1757429295.0,Sawyer Robertson is the best quarterback alive and people are just now catching on nationally. We have a chance in every game if he‚Äôs back there
1757429675.0,2-0 and the pick six streak is extended to 22 straight seasons. Which is legitimately one of the only things i care about the team getting each year. Defense looks beastly like usual and the offense looks worlds better than they did the past few seasons.
1757429710.0,"They learned. Crazy, right?   Rather than the run-run-run-punt from week 1, they let Potter throw it 42 times. Most of any Jimmy Rogers QB ever. They put up points as a result!  Washington State can never leave the Air Raid. I will die before that happens."
1757430775.0,hmm well we scored at least I guess
1757431145.0,"Indiana: offense didn't shoot themselves in the foot repeatedly like they did against ODU and the defense didn't allow any big plays  Army: beating a big 12 team on the road makes me feel much more optimistic for this season but also confused about what we are this year. Either way, Beat Navy!"
1757431229.0,We do offense now üòÅ
1757431309.0,"We might still only win 4 games or so, but this team is far better than last year. The game winning TD gets all the press, pressure, I'm more impressed by the defense. Our defense was one of the worst in the county last year, and this year it is much better so far. That goal line stand was huge."
1757433219.0,Jonah Coleman
1757433848.0,"‚òùÔ∏è Special teams, special plays, special players"
1757434344.0,UConn‚Äôs defense looks like it could be a legit top 50 unit at the end of this year. They held Syracuse in check for 3/4s of that game. The constant pressure had Angeli looking lost at multiple points during the game
1757437167.0,"We beat Michigan!!!! I still cannot believe it!! After the brutal last 2 years, THIS was the shot in the arm WE all needed, fans too. Boomer!"
1757437821.0,"This has been the best start for my two main teams since I can remember. Does anyone else have teams that in back to back weeks, all of college football talked about was firing the coaches they upset?"
1757438575.0,The only ones associated with VT that deserve applause are the fans that showed up at Lane stadium and supported the team. This team doesn‚Äôt deserve you.
1757441392.0,[Post redacted]
1757427249.0,Our true freshman QB is pretty dang good.  Our offensive line on the other hand‚Ä¶
1757427963.0,"No, I don‚Äôt think I will."
1757427573.0,We are the only triangle school that‚Äôs undefeated
1757427903.0,"2-0, let‚Äôs go!!!"
1757428139.0,MORE COWBELLS!!!!!
1757427521.0,"We blew out a team that we were expected to blow out. Offense looked more settled. Cig played a dangerous game keeping the starters in, but I get wanting them to get more live reps after how week 1 went."
1757427610.0,USC: Ja'kobi Lane
1757427626.0,"The Stroke is NOT the word, I will not clap"
1757427677.0,"In so many years, we would accept being down like that with 6 mins left in the fourth as our fate. But we came back to win. So much fight.   And our special teams don't suck!"
1757428017.0,You have that other team hope and then snatched it away. Well done
1757428040.0,First win against an FBS team!  Nice to see the program popping up on people's radars for a sec
1757428071.0,We beat up on our little bros for the first time in history.
1757428113.0,They looked terrible and still won 34-0.
1757428636.0,Toledo's rushing attack brought back memories of watching Kareem Hunt steamroll the MAC. And the defense absolutely locked down an extremely high-powered offenses in WKU. Emmanuel McNeil-Warren is going to continue the tradition of DBs being drafted very high.
1757428907.0,"I‚Äôm happy we‚Äôre trending up. I don‚Äôt know about Brennan, but he‚Äôs used to do a lot with little so I guess Arizona is a good spot"
1757429074.0,We're making progress. QB is much better than last year (not a high bar). Play calling is much better. Defense looks pretty stout.   We need a lot of work on the O line. Our schedule is still going to kill us. But I see signs of life overall which is nice.
1757429448.0,"Through two games, we have scored 108 points, the second most for our school ever, with 1913 being the year with the most.   I have NO idea if we are good or not, but this team is making fun facts."
1757429688.0,Having Dana Holgorsen has transformed this team. I know it was just Akron but I am struggling to remember since I started watching Husker football back in the late 00‚Äôs a more thorough beat down in all 3 phases. Just destroyed them and it was so refreshing to see.
1757429937.0,3 good quarters.  I beau-lieve.
1757429983.0,We doubled last year's win total.  How many teams have done that already?
1757432123.0,"Arkansas offense looks deadly, I think Taylen Green will be the best QB in the sec."
1757433701.0,Did what we were supposed to do against an FCS team. Played into the 4th string with no drop off.
1757434057.0,Running back is very deep.
1757434234.0,"We might have the best defense in the country again!  Also, the running game looks pretty good. I‚Äôm extremely confident in 3 backs.. and all are young!"
1757436614.0,We have a genuinely competent offense. We also have quality wide receivers for the first time arguably since Coleman/Carroo in 2013.
1757437081.0,How about no!
1757438163.0,"Our offense is fun to watch. Like, our QB was preseason rated to finish bottom of the Big Ten. Still early, but I like what I see."
1757441573.0,"This new qb transfer from Hogwarts ain‚Äôt half bad.  Jokes aside, Potter had a much better game this time around. Still have to wonder what‚Äôs up with Zevi though."
1757442921.0,We beat Alabama
1757443619.0,"Huskies scored a TD on all 10 of its offensive drives (excluding the last one where we kneeled to end the game). Admittedly it was an FCS school, but can't ask for more offensive production."
1757448738.0,We had an incredible 4th quarter comeback!
1757451314.0,Did you see that we took #18 USF down to the wire? Had them on the ropes until the very end.
1757428456.0,No
1757426758.0,"Defense was super shaky (although Lonergan was a baller), but Spartans pulled out the W which was great.  Chiles has matured a lot.  Last year he would've tried to force some of those passes and gotten picked off."
1757428193.0,Also no
1757428885.0,Yay we put up 100 on a middle school team
1757431040.0,Matt Patricia is going about as well as I hoped.  Sayin looks like he will be really great and getting better every week.
1757431090.0,Our 3rd string QB has a 1135 qbr. Obviously he's the best to ever play the game
1757427029.0,Baylor Hayes looked really impressive coming in to relieve a concussed Kirk Francis. The defense did their best to keep us in the game. It was a real 50/50 game and with a little more luck we win it. I still feel good.
1757427045.0,Whee survived two rain delays and made the Wake Forest QB throw a horrible pass
1757427320.0,Auburn isn‚Äôt awful.
1757427330.0,Go team
1757427346.0,We haven‚Äôt lost any big games yet.
1757427366.0,UCF: Scott Frost won a 1 score game and his playcalling looks as sharp as ever  Auburn: I‚Äôm afraid to say anything nice yet
1757427433.0,Despite passing issues our WR leads the SEC in yards as does our RB. Simmons is young but I will say he doesn‚Äôt let mistakes get to his head.

1757427627.0,We didn‚Äôt lose! (Didn‚Äôt win either)
1757427701.0,We took care of business after a long spell of absolutely not doing that.
1757427851.0,"So like, the stadium didn‚Äôt burn down. That‚Äôs great right?"
1757427932.0,"Couldn't have had a better outcome. P4 in the house, loads of season tickets purchased, Record crowd, about as Power conference of an atmosphere that you could squeeze into a MAC stadium, and a WIN."
1757428042.0,"Defense is flying around. Offense is not a record breaking attack led by a heisman winner and two stud first round WR‚Äôs, believe it or not."
1757428051.0,"The offense scored at will, and the defense got turnovers when it mattered in the second half so we could pull away, even if it was closer than I liked for a long time.  We didn‚Äôt let the weather delay beat us again like we did last year."
1757428076.0,"We are top ten for the first time in 24 years. Life is kind of good right now, and let's hope we can keep this ride going."
1757428109.0,I‚Äôll only acknowledge the 2nd half
1757428135.0,"for the first time in over 100 years of football existence, north texas won a game that they had never led untl the final whistle...kinda cool.  they beat western michigan in overtime"
1757428156.0,That kickoff return td was fire... but otherwise no.
1757428177.0,Two wins
1757428195.0,Defense good
1757428253.0,I‚Äôm afraid I must abstain.
1757428284.0,Both didn‚Äôt lose and defense is elite on both
1757428458.0,They have the pieces we just need to fit them together.
1757428501.0,"We‚Äôve played two games and only given up one TD, and that TD happened in garbage time. I get that Nevada and FIU aren‚Äôt the best opponents but we‚Äôre doing what we‚Äôre supposed to on defense."
1757428528.0,We didn‚Äôt lose this past weekend!
1757428567.0,2-0 is better than 0-2
1757428766.0,When your 4th string QB is getting reps in the 3rd quarter you know it was a good day.
1757428798.0,Fuck no
1757428825.0,"Pitching a shutout is tough, regardless of the competition."
1757428878.0,At least I can be confident in our defense for once
1757428919.0,"We passed for 140 yards against a BV defense.   I doubt we could have passed for 14 yards last year, so that‚Äôs nice."
1757429002.0,"Minus a few brain farts on Defense &amp; shooting ourselves in the foot thus far (WR drops, a fumble, red zone issues in wk 1) I think the talent on the field is noticable and improved from last year for IU.   If they can make it thru ILL, Iowa, &amp; OR at 2-1 (or somehow 3-0) this this is a double digit win team 100%"
1757429029.0,Our freshman WR Vernell Brown III has looked great and he‚Äôs also been doing very well on punt returns. We may also get to see 5 star freshman WR Dallas Wilson suit up against LSU for his debut.   I hope we‚Äôre able to retain some of this talent despite whatever happens with our head coach
1757429116.0,We‚Äôre 2-0  Our WR core looks like it belongs in D1 football and can actually get YAC.  Pass defense seems to be decent.  Still gonna get pasted by ND.
1757429181.0,BSU just revealed one of the coolest helmets ive ever seen
1757429284.0,"Back to putting up Chip era 1st half points, and comparing that to last year's start which ended as undefeated B1G Champs (nothing happened after that, season ended), could be a really really good year"
1757429384.0,ü¶Ü
1757429386.0,We seem to have a better offense. Run defense to be determined this weekend. This team would likely not lose to app state at home but probably best we keep them off the schedule
1757429468.0,I can‚Äôt believe that we are 2-0. I thought we would be 0-2.
1757429715.0,The university of Florida has a great basketball program
1757429716.0,Maryland possesses the nations longest non-conference win streak of 17 games. This is the B10s longest in 45 years.  People think Mike Locksley is a bad coach and if you live in New Mexico maybe your complaints are valid but he absolutely murders non-conference teams and SEC teams in bowl games.
1757429745.0,Swain is putting this team on his back right now
1757429757.0,Hell yeah brotherrrrrrr
1757429816.0,This could be our best QB + WRs combo in a long time!
1757429907.0,Our defense looks like an elite unit. If only we didn‚Äôt have the most predictable offense in human history
1757429924.0,Punt returns.
1757429963.0,The team came out and dominated the way you would want them to.
1757429989.0,Good news is our Offense looks much improved.   Bad news our defense gave up 20+ to G5 schools 2 weeks in a row so who knows if it‚Äôll matter.
1757430098.0,no thanks
1757430105.0,Diego Pavia. That is all.
1757430122.0,Needless to say I'm extremely pleased.  Never thought the season would start out like this.
1757430134.0,It is nice to have a good QB again. ‚Äò00s nostalgia is in!
1757430188.0,No
1757430211.0,Demond Williams has potential and I‚Äôm excited to see how he plays out this season.
1757430329.0,Defense still looks very good even though we‚Äôve played some obviously not great teams. I‚Äôm concerned about the offense (as usual) but a shutout this week and only giving up 3 outside of garbage time last week is great.   Chaz Coleman also looks like he‚Äôs going to be the next man up for PSU first round pass rushers which is very exciting.
1757430373.0,We didn't lose. But we will lose. Often
1757430450.0,Good job for literally running over the stupid bird team
1757430456.0,Look I'm the #1 chiles hater and like... he might be winning me over
1757430536.0,They got 69 points.  Nice.
1757430622.0,The D can stop the run now.   Thats it.
1757430684.0,"When you google Sewanee Football, the Wikipedia page comes up first before the results of their game. Anyways, we beat powerhouse Bethany College 41-6 last week and I‚Äôm sure will pummel North Carolina giant Brevard College"
1757430730.0,We beat our FCS matchup this year!
1757430764.0,"Jaden Nixon may be the best back in the conference, no I‚Äôm not overreacting because we played st Mary‚Äôs school for the deaf and blind"
1757430786.0,Aye! Aye!
1757430809.0,We‚Äôre looking good so far!
1757430823.0,I can't. Did not deserve to win at all. Sacramento State just wanted to win less.
1757430959.0,Love that defense!
1757431014.0,"The thing Bama did this week that they didn't do last week is hold their gaps on defense. I saw a youtube on the FSU game and it was horrible. And the other thing that was notable was how dialed in the backups were on defense.  They were head hunting.  UH has beaten Rice and Stephen F Austin, laying a claim to the Southeast Texas championship (TAMU aside)."
1757431036.0,"Offense could move the ball, defense was Swiss cheese"
1757431169.0,"Believe me, I would love to"
1757431206.0,No thank you lol
1757431277.0,Nope.
1757431372.0,"We finally scored a special teams TD. After a really long drought, that was great to see.  Unfortunately we followed it up by giving up a surprise inside kick. Oh well."
1757431391.0,Our head coach can apparently eat an entire box of crayons in one sitting.  Did you see the velocity on that spit?  That would have pinged epically off of a spittoon in a Hollywood western.
1757431409.0,"LSU Defense is finally playing like an LSU defense is supposed to play. If the offense can get it figured out, this could be a special year."
1757431485.0,Avery Johnson looked pretty damn good. Wish I could say the same for his receivers and defense.
1757431592.0,Defense has definitely improved from last year. Excited to see what else Tom Allen has in store!
1757431602.0,Well we didn‚Äôt just roll over and die.
1757431614.0,White had a great td run before his season ending injury.
1757431696.0,Our QB can actually complete long passes.
1757431717.0,"Defense looks the best it has in years. Curious to see how it holds up against Washington, Virginia, and Ole Miss"
1757431730.0,We won the game and have an elite RB.
1757431882.0,we looked great on offense and defense. run game and special teams are a bit of a head scratcher though. we were one blown play away from keeping michigan to field goals.
1757432115.0,Our O line is nasty   Dennis-Sutton is a monster
1757432137.0,No
1757432221.0,"We won!  Gets us to 1-1, which is where most people thought we'd be after two games, but we did it in an unexpected way."
1757432222.0,"We can move the ball down the field now, yay"
1757432279.0,It could have been so much worse.
1757432315.0,"Only took Monken a game and a half to abandon the passing game. Fuck that wanna be Air Force shit, run the damn ball"
1757432456.0,We didn‚Äôt lose
1757432484.0,There's nothing to applaud
1757432634.0,"There‚Äôs nothing to applaud. We lost to a MAC school, which cost us Gameday in Morgantown, and our two best players on offense are done for the year. What am I supposed to be happy about?"
1757432638.0,We beat a top 25 team and then got ranked for the first time in FCS
1757432662.0,"Texas Tech has started the season scoring 129-21. Non conference or not, it‚Äôs better than last year‚Äôs 68-88 in two games."
1757432763.0,We won two games we were supposed to win.    Have had previous years where our first loss came before the Autumn moon lights my way.
1757432897.0,Maybe drinking the kool-aid a little bit but our defense looks like 2021 Georgia or the 1985 Bears and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with that side of the ball. Special teams looks great too and Tiger should be great at return man as long as he doesn‚Äôt drop the football. Offense‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.im supposed to applaude my team here apparently so I won‚Äôt get into that except to say LJ is a beast
1757433014.0,Double the wins from last year!!!!!!!
1757433047.0,"Auburn:  beat the refs. They put up a good fight, but the refs just couldn‚Äôt mount the comeback   UNC:  didn‚Äôt lose"
1757433089.0,Our offensive line stinks but I think we're running the ball really well for what it is. Kewan Lacy is a stud
1757433457.0,We've played 80 players in the first two games and still look mildly competent while doing so
1757433551.0,We did what we should of done
1757434218.0,"We had an HBCU come into the stadium and the band held their own! What's better than Script Ohio? Four Script Ohios!  ...Wait is this about the football team? Yeah, they're pretty good."
1757434253.0,"Much like Bulldog fans when the stadium told them to follow the rules and stop ringing cowbells when the center is over the ball, my response to you is a simple but firm ""NO"""
1757434710.0,"Bent but didn't break against a legitimate G5 Playoff Spot contender. Our O-Line does make me wary the rest of the way, but I am optimistic.  70-0, and it seems like the proper space and respect was given to the Grambling band"
1757434747.0,We won against a cupcake and <em>didn‚Äôt</em> drop!   So this is how the other half lives‚Ä¶
1757435054.0,Beat kU. Beau is a dog. Cayden Green looked great at tackle.   Not much to complain about right now
1757435087.0,Two hilarious f-bombs caught on national television
1757435098.0,Tennessee well and truly doesn‚Äôt have anyone bigger than the T. Plus a record broken against ETSU in terms of total points scored by Tennessee against a single opponent.
1757435204.0,I used to pray for times like this.
1757435392.0,We‚Äôre incredible after the first quarter
1757435957.0,I want to thank both my teams for scheduling awful opponents early so that I have a month to get used to football before getting angry at my team.
1757435992.0,"You know somethings working right when you score 69 points, and one of the main highlights is cool blocks"
1757436042.0,"The defense did a good job of limiting the damage caused by the head coach sticking to the plan, even when it became obvious to everyone that the plan wasn't working."
1757436135.0,We have the best basketball team in the land at least for a few more weeks and we earned that on the court against a brutal final month schedule. ¬†  I got nothing else‚Ä¶
1757436336.0,"Successfully found our floor, and masking our offensive ceiling to everyone including our fan base by running only 3 plays through 2 weeks"
1757436389.0,Offense looked much better week 2.
1757436481.0,DEPTH
1757437129.0,Fuck no
1757437339.0,"Laurier with the 3-0 start to the season!   I was wondering how we'd look with Elgersma gone, but it looks like we'll be just fine."
1757437406.0,We're 2-0 for the first time since 2018  DON'T LOOK AT WHO WE PLAYED! TRUST ME THEY WERE TOUGH OPPONENTS!
1757438785.0,‚Ä¶
1757439718.0,"Ok guys, ok!"
1757439847.0,It‚Äôs still crabbing season
1757440417.0,I‚Äôm good
1757441136.0,I‚Äôd rather not
1757441329.0,Yeeeeesssssss
1757441362.0,"We only started the game with 2 turnovers instead of 3 this time!  But actually, our QB2 Philo is an absolute dog and I am a lot less worried about us being completely screwed should King be injured"
1757442184.0,2-0! But holy crap did we make it more difficult than it needed to be
1757443693.0,Well my teams collectively outscored their opponents 136-10 this weekend and both looked great doing so. So I'm pretty happy about that.
1757443930.0,No
1757446227.0,Defense played ok I guess
1757447434.0,Florida State - from 2-10 to two wins and ranked #10!  Tuskegee is 2-0 baby! First night game was a success from what I've seen.
1757448048.0,"Idk, I guess we beat the crap out of a team we were supposed to beat the crap out of?? ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
1757448439.0,"""We ran out of fireworks ... Ope, sorry!"""
1757459946.0,No.
1757466566.0,Congrats on not stopping the triple option at all.   Also congrats on the 7 minutes of possession in the second half. Top notch shit boys!
1757471054.0,"Nebraska made it all the way to our 4th string qb. Granted he only took 1 snap, but still, it‚Äôs been so long since we got to get so much of our roster some snaps"
1757481033.0,2-0 baby
1758467712.0,wtf is a win?
1758468762.0,Getting tired of all this winning!!!!
1758467080.0,I‚Äôm told Billy Napier‚Äôs background is on the offensive side of the ball. So far he‚Äôs only offended my eyes
1758466947.0,"jesus fucking christ what's the character limit on reddit? I could go for hours.  edit: I just got off work and had a bad day there so let's bitch about Napier and the Gators.  first off, fuck Napier. fuck his stupid face, fuck his lousy offensive play-calling, fuck his bum ass coaching attire, fuck how he leads games and fuck how he takes questions after his embarrassing losses. this dumb shit excuse of a coach has a losing record in his 4th fucking season, only seems to know that jet sweeps exist and looks like he paid $5 for his haircut. we're so fucking bad that teams don't or wouldn't have to cheat or steal calls to beat us. they all fucking know Billy has 4 play calls up his sleeve.  I'm not even kidding when I would say a dog could call fucking plays better than this dipshit, and the dog would be more likeable and could probably recruit better.   as a fan I feel like I'm literally stuck in purgatory. we're not outright dogshit. we have a solid defense and clearly skill players on offense. we're also clearly as good as every good team we've played, because every game has been close. so I know in my head a better coach could likely have us at 3-1 or maybe even 4-0. but I also know we can't win these games because I've been watching Napier for 4 years and he absolutely will coach his way out of big games every fucking time, almost the exact same way, every time.   I'm just so fucking tired of this shit. just hit the fucking nuke button and start over, I don't care anymore."
1758468069.0,28 straight losses to ranked teams. I‚Äôm tired boss
1758467886.0,"Uhhhhh... a once proud program has been basically completely destroyed.  We have zero culture, don't do anything well on the field, can't do the simplest thing like snap the ball, our offensive line stinks, we can't run, our 6'0"" 190 pound backup quarterback is getting crushed because we can't block anyone, we just got embarrassed by Maryland (no offense), and we are stuck with a giant buyout before we start our years long program rebuild.  Otherwise things are going great."
1758468999.0,Money gone Players gone Conference gone Now apples gone ‚òπÔ∏è
1758468273.0,-6 turnover margin will end up biting us at some point this year.
1758467070.0,Fucking fucks‚Ä¶. We are ass.
1758467054.0,Trent Dilfer.
1758467215.0,Where do I begin?
1758467284.0,Sun Belt Billy and Chris Ass
1758468889.0,FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1758467262.0,Nothing left. Just need a new coach.
1758469588.0,Arch stunting on some SHSU player post TD &amp; UT socials glazing him over it is such a bad look. You don‚Äôt post your slump buster for a reason. It‚Äôs not the flex you think it is.
1758467374.0,We‚Äôre led by a defensive guru mastermind who can‚Äôt coach a defense against a QB run. Or really any run. Who after 6 full years is .500. How does he even have a job
1758468073.0,I think Tyler from Spartanburg speaks for all of us.
1758467188.0,"If we keep making it look this easy, the conversation will keep being about how bad our opponents are instead of how good we are."
1758469201.0,‚ÄúClemson is just a few plays away from being undefeated‚Äù Dabos press conference this Tuesday.
1758467272.0,Rumor has it our old AD is playing shadow AD which is likely why Gundy is still around (and has that contract.) nothing will change unless the higher ups get rid of Gundy as well as the current and former AD.
1758466848.0,Chris Ass
1758467556.0,We scored too many points and now Illinois doesn‚Äôt look like a good ranked win. Get it together Cignetti.
1758467126.0,"Worst secondary we‚Äôve had in years.   Then again, we maybe have an offense?"
1758467144.0,"All the imagined good of beating two P4s came crashing back to earth when we played an <em>actually</em> good team. Granted we may discover Ole Miss has one of the best offenses in the country, but our defense looked horrible and our offensive playcalling was... offensive."
1758467273.0,Chris Ash is Brian VanGorder in disguise
1758468168.0,"I'll just paste this comment I found yesterday in the postgame thread:  <blockquote> Holy shit.<br/> The following are or could be considered nepo (Dabo friends and family) hires:      Tyler Grisham- Fmr CU player<br/> CJ Spiller - Fmr CU player<br/> Nick Eason - Fmr CU player<br/> Ben Boulware - Fmr CU player<br/> Deandre McDaniel - Fmr CU player<br/> Lorenzo Ward - Fmr Bama teammate<br/> Da‚ÄôQuan Bowers - Fmr CU player<br/> Tajh Boyd - Fmr CU player<br/> Cole Stoudt - Fmr CU player<br/> Elijah Turner - Fmr CU player<br/> Andrew Zow - Fmr Bama player<br/> Ryan Allen - DC‚Äôs kid<br/> Cory Crawford - Fmr CU player<br/> Tyrone Crowder - Fmr CU player<br/> Drew Swinney - nuff said<br/> Will Swinney - nuff said<br/> Brandon Thomas - Fmr CU player<br/> Nolan Turner - Fmr CU player<br/> Ben Batson - Fmr CU player<br/> Woody McCorvey - Longtime Clemson coach and Dabo‚Äôs position coach at Bama<br/> Tyler Clements - <strong>CU President‚Äôs kid (emphasis mine)</strong><br/> Zach Fulmer - Fmr CU player Ashley Spiers - Daughter of Bill Spiers, sister of Will Spiers both fmr CU players<br/> Levon Kirkland - Fmr CU player<br/> Tracy Swinney - Last name checks out<br/> Richard Yeargin - Fmr CU player<br/> Anna Kate Gunn - Gene Stallings‚Äô (Dabo‚Äôs HC @ Bama) granddaughter    This list may not be complete.

1758468193.0,"If you told me at the start we‚Äôd have the same record as Clemson after 4 games, I wouldn‚Äôt believe you. But here we are‚Ä¶"
1758468223.0,yeah yesterday sucked
1758467193.0,First flair: Hillman needs to Chill-man  Second flair: The curse of the one score loss won't die. Yeah the first week was a one score win but the death of the curse was... greatly exaggerated
1758467388.0,Our run game was non-existent
1758467416.0,Utah‚Äôs offense appears to still be garbage. Hoping this is the last season with Whitt and we actually try to be good on offense.
1758466850.0,"I mean, we won. But wasnt pretty."
1758466877.0,"For the first time in a long time: no, I don't think I will."
1758468658.0,63 freaking points???
1758467557.0,Maybe Larry Ellison can buy us a receiver or two next year...
1758467087.0,We lost to the bye week and gave up 24 points to Temple.
1758467121.0,Why
1758468419.0,I am just tired of Dave Doren
1758466985.0,Jay Norvell overthinks everything and I worry he‚Äôs not going to start the right QB next week  I think he‚Äôs done at CSU
1758468103.0,These defenses are going to speed up my hair loss
1758466935.0,The best part of every Temple game is realizing the Eagles play tomorrow.
1758466971.0,"I shouldn‚Äôt be complaining about Tech after picking up a big win, but solve the penalties. It‚Äôs going to cost us if we don‚Äôt stop committing them.  The defense was no getting the pressure they needed on Ball State. The QB was running around way too much"
1758467672.0,"I've kind of developed a weird relationship with Portland State and love watching them get their asses kicked at their high school equivalent home stadium. Usually afterwards their head coach will tell a joke or two about it too. It's a bit twisted, I know."
1758467984.0,I don‚Äôt want to hear from another announcer about how Rogers is a defensive minded guy until his defenses actually show up to the football games. I bet they couldn‚Äôt stop a high school team right now.¬†  Also glad it took being down 7 TD to UNT for him to finally roll the dice on the senior QB who balled out in the bowl game. Looked good against UW when his WRs weren‚Äôt losing the ball for no reason.
1758468381.0,We‚Äôre very very very bad at football
1758468137.0,"Can I get an OL not made of Swiss cheese, please?"
1758468483.0,"I do not like Hugh Freeze  That being said, Auburn got fucked yesterday big time.  UNC needs to figure its shit out"
1758467020.0,Beamer please why couldn‚Äôt you get LaNorris some help? We might have the worst RB room in the country.
1758467646.0,"I still think Beamer doesn't hold practice during the off-season. We're not even getting the fundamentals of football right. Penalties out the ass, everyone plays without a sense of teamwork, no communication, just really basic things literally every team takes for granted we do not have. And it's entirely a coaching issue"
1758472463.0,Where do I fucking start
1758473410.0,Maybe run it up the middle again? Try the bubble screen for once! And don‚Äôt forget to run it up the middle!
1758474150.0,JUST LOSE. JUST LOSE THE FUCKING GAME LIKE A NORMAL TEAM. STOP SPENDING 3 HOURS EDGING ME JUST TO TURN OVER AND GO TO SLEEP AT THE END. FUUUUUUCK
1758466925.0,None here.
1758466972.0,Can't
1758467027.0,+3 TO and winning on a walk off field goal isn't a great strategy long term
1758467937.0,We are not very good

1758467176.0,"So obviously without our top 2 RBs and top WR being banged up, a controlling win where we covered the spread until our backup D was in and gave up some garbage time scores to backend cover is alright. But our OL play is still not good, and Moss has some clear limitations when the blitz gets to him. Really wish he‚Äôd move around more. This game against Pitt especially do we are without Isaac and Duke again is going to be extremely hard if he‚Äôs not on."
1758467433.0,Our kicking is going to cost us at least one game this year. Sucks that our starting kicker had to go down with a season-ending injury in the first game. Our secondary needs work too.

1758467493.0,"I mean we can't run and even when we can run we take sacks so that the stats say that we still can't run. We have the ball first and goal from the one after actually running so hey let's run a long developing pass play that results in Sellers taking a 20 yard sack and oh shit my bad this comment was called for 20 false starts, a hold, and probably a targeting that the refs overturned for some reason. Anyone and everyone can run through us because it sounds like the team has decided why tackle when you can just launch yourself aimlessly and for fuck's sake Shane's tenure has been marred by inconsistency so hey why work to fix that 14 penalties and 40 missed tackles atop some shit ass playcalling and someone a worse OL than Rattler got fuck off."

1758471113.0,"I‚Äôm upset Behren Morton got hurt and Hammond played lights out.   Now a good chunk of our fanbase wants to move on from our Qb#1. Hammond is the future, but he is inconsistent.

1758482011.0,"The defense is garbage full of fetid meat on a hot day covered with black flies.  Three sacks the whole season is indicative of the lack of production from the line.

1758475604.0,"Honestly with the way San Diego State looked against Cal in the first half, especially after forcing a turnover on downs on the first Cal drive that ended at the SDSU 2, that game was over at halftime and they were down only 13-0.  Wilcox teams might be able to hold off teams after building up a multiple-score lead (and not even against Miami last year) but not since 2018 (aside from the 2022 Big Game) has a Wilcox team  shown resiliency in coming back from being down big, with the exception of Oregon State in 2023 but that defense was just ass against DJU and they just couldn't keep up.  Now Cal is back in its familiar place as a laughingstock and making fanbases of other teams wonder if they are that bad considering how they managed to lose to Kal  2022 CU  2024 FSU  2025 SDSU"

1758468068.0,"We have an offense that is capable of winning 8+ games.      Our defense and specials teams are so bad, that it leaves no margin for error and is going to force shootouts every week.  Seems like another 6-6 kinda season."

Our QB is a fraud, the Defense looks decent at times, and then hilariously bad in others, the offense is lost, I‚Äôm seeing our Football coach finagle with a 25 year old on national television, Freddie Kitchens is a football terrorist, there‚Äôs no end in sight, and we play FUCKING CLEMSON in two weeks, who sucks, humiliating the ACC even further. Goddammit."
1758468866.0,If play calling really is Billy's favorite part of the game then by all means he should continue to do it -- somewhere else.    Let him take his big giant pile of money and go call plays at a level where he can be successful. This ain't it.    If he had just hired a decent OC we might not need to have this conversation. But I think it's too late for that now.
1758468902.0,Our run D wasn't great and the attempts at long passes were not working
1758468935.0,"How much time do you have?   FINALLY have a guy under center who oozes potential and has an arm as good as anyone and we can‚Äôt block more than .5 seconds for him? Some delusional gamecock fans will try to pin last nights loss on Sellers (I‚Äôve seen it in my teams sub) as if he isn‚Äôt the ONLY reason we only lost by 9 last night. Yeah he made some bad throws here and there. What do you expect when you have an offensive line made of Swiss cheese?  I refuse to believe it‚Äôs a talent issue. Beamer should‚Äôve given Teasley the boot 2 years ago and promoted Elliot back to the position. And then our defense doesn‚Äôt know how to tackle and let‚Äôs not one but two running backs rush for 280 on us. Not to mention all the penalties we had. Just undisciplined all around.   Then ofc we still have Mike fucking Shula. Tell me, your quarterback gets us down to the 1 yard line and then you follow it up by having us go backwards 20 yards. Just fucking pathetic"
1758469146.0,"The defense playcalling on 3rd and long has been atrocious, Brian Ward will never learn. Other than the 3rd and long situations, defense has played well this season.  I want Dilly to take over the offense playcalling, Arryo‚Äôs playcalling has no creativity and the offense somehow stalled a lot in the redzone yesterday."
1758469222.0,Defense needs to be more elite if we want to show up in the playoffs
1758469338.0,It‚Äôs a miracle that our eight false start penalties didn‚Äôt lose us the game. Wtf was that.
1758469362.0,Going to be another disappointing year that ‚Äúseems‚Äù better than it is because our schedule is an absolute cupcake factory. This is the year OSU will be back on top and I haven‚Äôt yet come to terms with that.

1758470234.0,Where do I start?
1758470302.0,"I‚Äôm super proud of the Frogs being undefeated at this point, but the offensive line has to plan meaner and cleaner or it could bite us badly later on. Hoover who is a star threw some of the most questionable balls yesterday with many sailing high above tall guys or five yards out of bounds it was a generally confusing performance. The Defensive line is playing too soft in the middle leading to rushes that shouldn‚Äôt get half the yards they do and on pass defense they need to put in more work on sticking to their man as they have been abused at times and our starting kicker needs to get healthy. Discipline needs to be instilled. I get that emotions are high when you make a great athletic play but you have to celebrate with your team not in the face of the guy you beat. Carroll‚Äôs penalty after a 3rd down stop deflated the defense as they had done what they needed to do and he got in the receivers face while he was on the ground the defense was so disappointed and tired they went on to let up a score."
1758471224.0,"Same old fucking Cal. Look decent for the first few games, then completely faceplant. I shouldn't be surprised by now."

1758474403.0,"Chris Ass is a god awful DC, it's clear something happened during the break because second half defense started stunting at the line and bringing actual pressure beyond 4 man fronts that go nowhere. I'm wondering if Freeman took away play calling from him because it looked night and day different.   Our offense FINALLY looks modern and deadly and our defense decides to fall completely off the planet. What the fuck."
1758474937.0,UW‚Äôs defense is looking spotty.  I‚Äôve got a bad feeling about how many points Ohio State will put up at Montlake next week.

1758477030.0,Stopping the run doesn't mean letting them throw for 300 yards instead lol.
1758477368.0,Our coaching staff play calls have always been horrendous. We could have made it to where ASU would have tied the game on the last kick if we didn‚Äôt piss away easy field goals at the start of the game by always going for it on 4th. The wins we have rely on dumb luck or a handful of players refusing to lose. This week our running back refused to lose but his effort wasn‚Äôt enough to beat our coaches. If you could drink in a Baylor game it would be ‚Äútake a drink for anytime the fans wonder why they chose that play to run‚Äù   What upsets me the most is we have potential to be so good too

We probably shouldn‚Äôt have won that game (despite getting 10 sacks for massive losses).    We need some damn turnovers. Defense has greasy gamer fingers when it comes to tips and bad passes.

Having lost two very winnable games because we can‚Äôt seem to play anything close to a complete game. The offense is clicking, the defense can‚Äôt stop a run to save their life. The defense locks in and holds ASU to 9 points off 3 turnovers, offense can‚Äôt hardly move the ball. The only thing we‚Äôre consistently good at is punting and we hardly do that.  The team is constantly starting games without energy.  I don‚Äôt know if the answer is firing Dave or not, but something has to give. I don‚Äôt even know if there‚Äôs anyone worth hiring this cycle.   Holy shit that game was so frustrating to watch. It might have actually broken me as a Baylor fan.

1758470582.0,Officiating was BAD but do we win without a few favorable overturns? I really want a breakdown of the busted coverage ‚Äúsubstitution‚Äù play and the forced fumble TD ‚Äúincomplete pass‚Äù and I‚Äôm sure a lot of people want it.
1758470597.0,"LSU: Sure we put up 56 yesterday but we still have yet to score more than 23 against an FBS team, we‚Äôll have to do better if we want to beat Ole Miss  MTSU: existence is pain"

1758470922.0,They should all just quit football....
1758470946.0,If we catch those those two potential ints or just house that that looked like it was potentially a walk in the whole tone of that game shifts.  We got to generate a run game  Otherwise. Im ecstatic with the defense.
1758470964.0,My 3 key takeaways from Arkansas‚Äô weekend: 1. Fire Pittman 2. Sam Pittman should be unemployed 3. There should be a new head coach of the Razorbacks

1758471172.0,"Mateer. I love him but I‚Äôve never seen a Heisman caliber QB with as many easily fixable issues as he has, that simply do not get fixed.  If you‚Äôre going to run, run. Don‚Äôt stand back there reading the papers and then decide to do something with your legs once the pocket is collapsing. You‚Äôre not actually as fast as the first 3 weeks led you to believe you are.  Not every throw needs to be a bullet pass. The object is for your receiver to catch it, not be speared on the end of it.  If you could maybe not commit one brain dead turnover a game that would be nice.  Yes our OL is not great, you know what helps that? Stepping up in the pocket so the guards can seal the edges around you.  Again, all shit that is eminently coachable, but needs to be coached up and coached out yesterday before the rest of the SEC figures him out and we limp to 7-5."
1758471223.0,There's not enough eggs in the world to satisfy the number I want to throw at SEC officiating

1758941755.0,"Real talk though, even if (hopefully) that FSU DB didn‚Äôt get trampled, imagine just being stuck there in a crowd of navy and orange trying to find the exit"
1758941754.0,That‚Äôs just dangerous. That receiver was still sitting while fans were rushing right on top of him.
1758941753.0,Why were the fans already on the field?
1758941751.0,Field storming will be ban because of this lol.
1758941750.0,That was a great watch

1758941723.0,Why no replay ?  Rigged .. fire goodell
1758941722.0,So my question is to what degree is our defense horrible/ Virginia‚Äôs offense elite? What‚Äôs the balance there?
1758941721.0,They‚Äôre definitely going to be required to build some kind of blockage to prevent that from happening again lol
1758941719.0,I FUCKING LOVE COLLEGE FOOTBALL
1758941719.0,"And we introduce you, <em>by an interception by the Beavers</em>  Brother, what????"
1758941718.0,"I love a good field rush, but it would be prudent to have a wall installed at the edge of that hill to slow it down a bit."
1758941717.0,Hope the WR and DB are good. My god that rush was instant.
1758941714.0,Scheduling two bums at home right before having to go on the road and face a tough team was probably not a good idea. Thank you for your service FSU.

1758941689.0,"3 bad calls one after the other in the overtimes:<br/> Lousy non-call on the PI<br/> Stopping the play clock when Virginia didn't know the overtime rules<br/> Overturning that catch (yes, you can hold a ball with your fingertips).  To be fair, this one was really close, and I can see thinking it wasn't a catch.  Still, I thought it was a catch and that they got it wrong."
1758941689.0,Anyone catch the dude running in front of Castellanos with his middle finger lmfao

1758941660.0,"Damn, they nearly ran over the players."
1758941629.0,Did we just watch UV students kill a guy?
1758941651.0,"I'm probably in the minority, but that was ridiculous. Fans should not rush the field that quick. Someone could get hurt. The receiver looked like he was trampled."
1758941506.0,Holy shit hopefully nobody gets hurt
1758941512.0,DO NOT TRAMPLE THE MAN WHO JUST WON YOU THE GAME YOU FUCKS

Would be nice for sure."
1758954667.0,They need to fire Bray immediately. Fuck saving money on his contract by waiting. At this point you have to make a statement out of respect for this program.
1758954559.0,Houston was off this game because it‚Äôs extremely cold and a extremely late night start

On the one hand, OSU fans were being really cocky, on the other I‚Äôm not a fan of the attitude. Whatever. At least UH is 4-0. Hopefully Fritz can figure out time management and the players will stop committing so many fouls before the tech game"
1758954379.0,Team might collapse after this outing. Feel for OSU bros

1758954281.0,Akimbo finger gunning and waving bye to a winless team you had to mount a comeback to beat is certainly a choice.
1758954280.0,"Ayyyyyy, LFG. My heart can finally try to get out of tach.  WHOSE HOUSE?"
1758954280.0,"Someone go buyout all the bleach in Corvallis, for beavers sake"

1758948966.0,Good job ASU. Always something <del>cursed</del> special about the desert on a Friday night that makes it awesome to tune into <del>when the opposing team isn't one's own</del>.
1758948922.0,Did we ever actually get any evidence of a field storming or is it time to put Tim Brando in a home?
1758948741.0,They sure left that stormed field pretty quickly.
1758948739.0,Why did the announcers say there was a crowd rush? There is no one on the field
1758948737.0,Everyone talking shit about rushing the field.. objectively I get it: beating #24 isn‚Äôt anything to write home about.  But if you watched the game and the absolute swing in momentum the fans were hyped as fuck. Sometimes emotions just take over.
1758948711.0,Tcu could suck this s*** from the back
1758948699.0,Anyone else gonna grab one of those heart rate monitor rings?

1758948608.0,Get rekt TCU
1758948594.0,Yeah okay y‚Äôall are ruining the art of field storming. It‚Äôs supposed to be when you take down one of the big dogs (like when we beat Alabama and Georgia) not for beating a team you were already favored against‚Ä¶

1758948535.0,Wasn't ASU favored in this game? Rushing the field is a choice
1758948533.0,Rushing the field after beating #24 TCU via getting bailed out by the referees is very cringe
1758948533.0,Pac12 after dark never dies!
1758948528.0,Alright time to move over to the Houston Oregon State game. Tonight has had great games so far.
1758948526.0,How many interceptions did TCU get in the 4th quarter alone?  Holy fuck
1758948525.0,Never ever play in Arizona on a Friday night.
1758948524.0,"Rushing the field isn't just about the opponent or their ranking, it's about the vibe and flow of the game itself"
1758948520.0,Are we even sure that anyone rushed the field. I wouldn't be surprised if Brando was just hallucinating.
1758948520.0,Two lossing ranked undefeated teams on a friday night.  Crazy weekend already
1758948519.0,[deleted]
1758948517.0,What happened after the touchdown?  How did ASU get the ball back?  The ESPN app didn‚Äôt have the play-by-play tonight and my antenna feed was messing up ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1758948512.0,"Good game, Frogs! All the best to y'all going forward!"

1758948484.0,"If this team could play a complete 4 quarters, they could be excellent. They've never put a full game together yet this season it feels like."

1758948483.0,BIG 12 now seems interesting.

1758948456.0,"That's how you know a team is good, whenever they play sloppy, with penalties, and still win the game. A great team always overcomes the hill"

1758948402.0,It‚Äôs hard not to like Dillingham
1758947857.0,"I've been screaming this into the void for years:  In a scenario like this, how is it not better to let them score? 1:30 left on the 3 yard line, 2nd down. You can stop them 2 times and waste 2 time outs and have like 40 seconds left after they kick a field goal and 1/no timeouts, or you can just let them score and have all 3 timeouts and 1:30 to go score. I feel like you should let them score every time."
1758948378.0,Yall just watched a major upset with the favourite blowing a 17-0 lead
1758948429.0,They rushed the field in a dignified manner
