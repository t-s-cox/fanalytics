A target is when you target the  1c. Let me start over  1c-a. The tackler is not allowed to do a motion to the, uh, opponent, that prohibits the player from doing, you know, just trying to hit the other guy with the crown of your helmet. You can't do that.  1c-b. Once the defender is in the launch position, he can't be over here and say to the runner, like, \"I'm gonna get ya! I'm gonna knock you out! You better watch your butt!\" and then just be like he didn't even do that.  1c-b(1). Like, if you're about to tackle and then don't look, you have to still look. You cannot not look. Does that make any sense?  1c-b(2). You gotta be, vulnerable act of playing ball, and then, until you just throw your helmet and body at a guy and try to kill him.  1c-b(2)-a.
